# GP Tool Wheel
*a Grease Pencil addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3.0+ –– switch quickly between tools*

![GP Tool Wheel in action](docs/images/gp_tool_wheel_in_action.gif)

Using Grease Pencil and switching a lot between modes and tools? Then GP Tool Wheel can speed up your workflow: it combines mode and tool selection in one delicious wheel.


## How to use the wheel
By default you can invoke the tool wheel with the pie menu shortcut: `Tab` or `Ctrl`-`Tab`. You can change this shortcut easily, by [customizing your wheel](#customize-your-wheel).

Selecting a tool doesn't need an explanation: click on an icon and you are good to go.

> **Neat detail:** you don't *have* to select a tool. When clicking *outside* the active mode panel (marked with the colored dot), you just switch modes. Like you would with the default pie menu.

## Customize your wheel
For the add-on preferences, go to `Edit` > `Preferences...` > `Add-ons` and look for `3D View: GP Tool Wheel`. Click on the arrow on the left.

Here you can compose your ideal, tailor made wheel. Perhaps you want to change it in a kind of 'Quick favorites' menu, with only the modes and tools you often use.

It's recommended to change the keyboard shortcut when you don't include all the modes in your wheel.
